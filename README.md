# Buckle up your eyeballs and get ready for a technicolor joyride through the wonderland of ShockBliss! This ain't your grandma's photography â€“ unless your grandma was a time-traveling, rainbow-riding, psychedelic sorceress. We conjure up images that are like a party in your brain, where colors dance, lines wiggle, and reality takes a backseat to awesome. ShockBliss is a celebration of weirdness, a love letter to the unconventional, and a big, fat "YES!" to letting your freak flag fly. So come on in, the water's fine (and probably glowing in the dark).
Shockbliss.com is the porfolio and E-commerce website for our "art meets tech" projects. Visual artist: Ani Parviainen. Our first project is the website and product creation. The products available to buy will be displayed on the website. In addition, we will use this site to showcase our upcoming exhibitions that combine the artist's Shockbliss brand and AR/VR experience to provide experiences not only limited to physical space and matter.
